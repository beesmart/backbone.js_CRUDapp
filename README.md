backbone.js_CRUDapp
===================

An annotated CRUD app using source code from https://github.com/thomasdavis/

Annotated with 8 Steps (I called them jobs). To help me understand what's going on in this CRUD app.
Original code by Thomas Davis (https://github.com/thomasdavis/backbonetutorials/tree/gh-pages/videos/beginner).
The code has no XSS functions so consider this when using the code.
